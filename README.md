# interactive-shapes
This is my final project for [Creative Coding Playground](https://www.index-space.org/products/creative-coding-playground-1)

### description
A user can select the shape of choice: circle, square or triangle and adjust the stroke weight and velocity by using a range slider in the sidebar.  On mouseover, the user can change the fill color of the selected shape to a random rgb color.  On mouseclick, a user can delete the selected shape.  A `reset canvas` button allows a user to revert the shapes array back to the original number, but adding back however number of shapes are missing from the original length of the shapes array (20).
